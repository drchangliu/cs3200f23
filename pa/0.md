# PA0: Intro. to OCaml

**Due**: Monday, Week 3 at 11:59pm.

Your goal in this assignment is to familiarize yourself with OCaml,
the programming language we'll be using for much of this course.

## Part 1: "Install OCaml"

Follow the instructions for [starting OCaml](../starting-ocaml.md).

## Part 2: Complete the Exercises

You will develop and submit your assignment through GitHub. To start
this process, first *accept the assignment* by visiting
[https://classroom.github.com/a/ye0au_Nm](https://classroom.github.com/a/ye0au_Nm)
(this will create a new private repository in which you should develop
your solution). Clone the repository onto your local machine in order
to begin working. Your last commit to this repository before the due
date will count as your assignment submission. If you forget how to
use Git and/or GitHub, read more online (e.g.,
[https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners](https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners)).

The template repository contains a dune (the standard OCaml
build tool) project structure, including `bin/`, `lib/`, and `test/`
directories. For this assignment, you may safely ignore the `bin/` and
`test/` directories. Your job is to open the file `lib/lib.ml`, read
the instructions, and complete the exercises contained within.

We use an automated testing framework, not only to make grading
easier, but also to help guide your implementation. Run the command
`dune test` at the command line to compile the project and evaluate
the test cases. Your submission should pass all tests.
